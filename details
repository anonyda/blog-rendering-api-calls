Use features of Asynchronous JavaScript and generate a blog page. The blog page fetches data from a remote repository or data source through asynchronous JavaScript fetching mechanisms. The rendered blog page should contain a list of related links that contain the title of other blogs. Upon clicking the related link, details of this new blog should be displayed on the page. A sample application UI is given at the link.

The web page should have following components

Header with navigation links and logo
Footer with related links and social media icons
Blog body with a main blog content and aside section with related links
The web page UI and styling can be selected by the developer.
